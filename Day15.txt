==>> Introduction to Angular:::::
= Angular is a Typescript Framework for developing dynamic web-applications

NOTE:
= web-applications (websites)
Ex:
	www.fb.com
	www.yahoo.com
	www.gmail.com

= dynamic here means data in websites changes wrt to 3-things
a) Time		(News-Update) Ex: Google-News
b) Location	(Weather-Report) Ex: Google-Weather	
c) User		(Email/Social-Networking)	Ex:Gmail,Facebook

= To develop web-apps in Angular we require Typescript
(Scripting or Programming in HTML webpages)

= HTML (How to display data using <tags>)
= CSS  (It makes HTML-data more stylish i.e, colors,styles etc)
= Javascript/Typescript (Used as programming in webpages)

= Framework (Runtime-Lib + Runtime-Environment)
(Library means Modules in Typescript)

= It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript
=(***) Angular is written in Typescript 
= Typescript compiles to Javascript and displays dynamic-information/data in Browser


= Some Notable-Features in Angular are,
	a) HTTP Service
	b) Animations
	c) Materials etc
	d) Auto-complete
	e) Navigations
	f) Toolbars
	g) Menus 
	h) Routings (SPA) 
	i) Components
	j) Services etc


=> Pre-Requisites::
	a) HTML
	b) CSS
	c) Javascript
	d) Typescript
	e) DOM

==>> History of Angular:::::
= AngularJS is known as Angular-1 
(written in Javascript)- 2009 (2012 by Google)
(AJS is Javascript Framework for developing web-apps)

NOTE:
(java v/s .net)
= Both of them has OOP
= Difference is Programming Syntaxes


= Angular-2 (written in Typescript) - Sep 14, 2016
= Angular-3 (skipped)
= Angular-4 (March 23, 2017)
= Angular-5 (November 1, 2017)
= Angular-6 (May 4, 2018)
= Angular-7 (October 18, 2018)
= Angular-8 (May 28, 2019)


=> NOTE:
= All version are backward compatible and expected a new-version every 6 months
= In new-versions some old feature would be deprecated(outdated) and added with new library

=> Angular(TS) is based on Components and Services Architecture. Whereas Angular JS is based on M-V-C Architecture


=> Enhancements Angular-4/5/6/7/8:
= "if" is supported in Angular-2 where as Angular-4 onwards supports "if-else" also
= "as" keyword in for-loop from Angular-4 onwards
= Animation package is separate 
(@angular/animations before @angular/core)
= Condition based Animation disable feature
= use <ng-template> instead of <template> 
(it is already available in HTML)
= From Angular-4 onwards, we require Typescript 2.2+
= Pipe titlecase Ex: {{'Welcome to Angular' | titlecase}}
= http get api is simplified from Angular-4 onwards with HttpClient (URLSearchParams)
= Small and Fast Apps

= Progressive Web apps from Angular5 onwards
= Material Design Enhancements from Angular5
= ngUpdate, ngAdd, RxJS-6 Enhancements from Angular6
= App Performance, Virtual Scrolling from Angular7
= Typescript 3.1, RxJS-6.3, Node10 support from Angular7
= Finally Angular8, Fast Rebuild time, template type-checkings, backward compatibility

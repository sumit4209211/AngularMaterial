==> Todays Topics:-
= Events in Angular
= Event-Binding in Angular
= Programs on Events

==> Events in Angular:-
= Event is a communication between a user and HTML Webpage

= In Javascript, we have some events such as,
onClick=""
onChange=""
onKeyPress
onKeyDown
onMouseOver
onMouseEnter
onMouseExit
onFocus
onBlur
onSubmit
onScroll
...etc


= When these events occur in webpage, we perform some operation or call a Javascript function

= In Angular, we use these events as "Event-Binding" Mechanism

= Event-Binding mechanism is done on HTML Input Controls or other HTML Elements
Ex: text-box/number-box/text-area/radio-btns/btns/submit/checkbox etc
	<div>,<p>,<h1>......</h6> etc
	
= In Angular, when event occurs we call typescript function
= These TS functions, we have to write in corresponding Component-classes


= In Angular, we use [] property-binding to get dynamic data from Component Class Variables to HTML-attributes
Ex:-
<input type="text" id="" name="" [value]="uname" bind-disabled="bool"/>

NOTE:-
= Here in Event-Binding, we send or flow information from HTML to Component-class

= For this we use () Event-Binding operator
Ex:
(click) = "f1()"
(mouseover) = "f2()"
etc...

= Finally, this whole process in known as "Event-Handling Mechanism"


//Program (demo-app ----> comp3)
cmd> ng g c comp3
g -> generate
c -> component


= Add following code in comp3.component.html
<h3>Component3 Event-Binding</h3>
<button (click)="f1($event)">
            CLICK-ME
        </button>
        <span>{{msg}}</span>

= Add following code in Comp3Component-class of comp3.component.ts
	msg="";
  f1(event)
  {
	console.log("You have HIT ME");
	alert("HIT Button is Clicked");
  console.log(event);
  console.log(event.pageX+","+event.pageY);
    this.msg="You Clicked the button at ("+event.pageX+","+event.pageY+")";
  }

NOTE:-
= $event is a special object provided by angular for every webpage
= This $event is same as in Javascript and also Typescript
= Using this event, we can get more information about event in Angular webpage (Current-Event)
=* $event is separate for every event in angular-webpage


Ex:-
<hr />
        <div> Weekdays(with Events) :
            <select (change)="f2($event)">
                <option *ngFor="let i of days">{{i}}</option>
            </select>
        </div>
        <span>{{msg2}}</span>
<hr />

= Add following code in Comp3Component-class of comp3.component.ts
f2(event)
  {
	  console.log("You have CHANGED DAY");
    alert("DAY is Changed from Combo-box");
    console.log(event);
    this.msg2="You have changed the day as :"+event.target.value;
  }

(and)
days = ["Sunday","Monday","Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"];

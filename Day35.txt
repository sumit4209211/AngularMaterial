==> Todays Topics:-
=> CSS in Angular
=> ngStyle, ngClass directives in Angular
=> Programs

=> What is CSS?
= It stands for Cascading Style Sheets

= HTML (display the data in webpage)
= CSS (makes HTML-data more stylish,colorful,interactive)

= CSS in Angular using [style.cssprop]="'cssvalue'"
= CSS in Angular using [ngStyle]="{cssname:cssvalue,...}"


==> Class Binding in Angular Webpage:-

b) class-based CSS::::
= In html, we apply class based CSS as follows,
<style>
	.c1
	{
		color:blue;
	}
</style>
Ex:
	<h3 class="c1">.........</h3>

= The main use of class-based CSS is it will apply common CSS for group a of HTML-elements


= In Angular, we apply this using Class-Binding feature
Ex:
	<h3 [class]="'c1/class_var'">.........</h3>
	
//Here we can apply directly CSS-Class & also dynamically Comp-Class-Property(Data-prop)
= Give class-name in single-quotes ''
= class-var then single-quotes is not-required

= [class] attribute is used in [] binding operator


=> Other Syntax:-
	<h3 [class.c1]="true/false">.........</h3>
= Here true means c1-class is applied to <h3>
= Here false means c1-class is NOT-applied to <h3>
	
	
=> Applying multiple-class CSS at a time,
<h3 [ngClass]="{c1:true,c2:false,..}">.........</h3>
//Here {} is javascript-object
= c1 is true then it is applied to <h3>
= c2 is false then it is NOT-applied to <h3>


NOTE:- (3-ways of working with class-based CSS in Angular)
i) 	[class]="'classname'"
	[class]="class-var-name" (Data-prop in comp-class)
	
ii)	[class.c1]="true/false"	

iii) [ngClass]="{c1:true,c2:false,....}"
(Apply mutliple-class-css at a time)
	
	
//Program (comp88 ----> "demo-app")
(Program to apply class-based CSS in angular(3-ways))

Ex:-
<div>
    <h3>Working with class, ngClass attrs</h3>
    <p [class]="'c1'">This is Para9</p>
    <p class="c2">This is Para10</p>
    <hr />
    <p [class.c1]="true">This is Para11</p>
    <p [class.c2]="bool">This is Para12</p>
    <hr />
    <p [ngClass]="{c1:true,c2:false,c3:true}">This is Para13</p>
    <p [ngClass]="myClasses">This is Para14</p>
</div>
(and in comp-class)
  bool=true;
  myClasses = {
    c1:false,
    c2:true,
    c3:true
  };


===>>> Other CSS in HTML:-
c) tag-based CSS: (comp88.component.css)
= this css is applied to all the matching-tags 
<style>
	p
	{
		text-align:center;
		font-size:23px;
	}
</style>
Ex:
	<p>This is para1</p>


d) id-based CSS: (comp88.component.html)
= id based is applied to that particular element only
<style>
	#p9
	{
		font-family:courier new;
		
	}
</style>
Ex:
	<p id="p9">This is para9</p>


NOTE:
Angular supports mainly 2 CSS, they are 
1) Style-based ([style] or [ngStyle]="{}")
2) Class-based ([class] or [class.classname]="boolean" or [ngClass]="{}")


=> Applying Global CSS in Angular:-
= Under src/styles.css
p{
	font-style:italic;
	width:50%;
}
= This css is applied to all the <p> in root-comp and all the child-comp's whereever we have <p>'s

//Program (Assignment)
(Create a webpage to display collection of images in Angular with CSS in Angular)

==> Assets in Angular:-
= In every Angular app, we have assets folder under src/assets folder

= In this folder we put our application-resources like images,pics,files,docs,videos etc

= Such resources can be used directly in Root-Comp, as well as Child-Comp

==> Todays Topics:-
=> Creating & running Angular Application 
=> Angular Application Folder Structure
=> About Modules & Components


==> Creating First Application in Angular:-
cmd>ng new first-app(FirstApp)
= It creates new Angular-App in our working directory
= It does this operation using Net connection
= Complete folder for our Angular-App is created and necessary files are downloaded from Internet
= Bascially necessary files are packages required for our Angular-App (Library files)

cmd>cd first-app(FirstApp)

cmd>first-app(FirstApp)>ng serve
= (or)npm start (alternate command)
= Our Angular-App (first-app) is compiled to javascript format
= Angular Live Development Server starts (with the help of Node)
= Next our Angular-App is registered with Server
= Next our Angular-App(first-app) is line/online at given URL
(http://localhost:4200/)


NOTE:
= Finally open the browser and access above URL
= We can see index.html from our Angular-App(first-app)


NOTE:
= Angular Live Development Server is online at http://localhost:4200

= Open the browser and type above URL to view your first-app Homepage (index.html)


==> Application Project Folder Structure:-
= In VS-Code, 
Click File -> select Open-Folder -> Goto Working Directory and select "first-app" -> Open Folder

= In VS-Code, Explorer open and our Project Folder appears on the left side

=> Important Files in our Application:-
i)
= package.json
(Provides information about all the packages used in our app)
(All these Packages are available under "node_modules" folder)

ii)
= index.html (it is in "src" folder)
= It is Homepage for our Angular App(first-app)

iii)
= main.ts
= It is file which provides information to Angular Live Dev Server about flow of execution of Angular-App

NOTE:
= This file provides from where our application should start running
"bootstrapModule(AppModule)"
AppModule is app.module.ts (it is in app folder)

= app.module.ts (Root Module)
(This file says our application flow should start with AppComponent i.e, app.component.ts (it in same folder))

= app.component.ts (Root Component)
(This file provides typescript-class)
(In this file we have information about our view)
(view means display of info in webpage i.e, index.html)
(View is provided by selector(app-root))
(<app-root></app-root> is used in index.html as custom-tag)
(for this selector, we have templateUrl(.html file) & styleUrls(.css file) )
(Finally, .html+.css is the view in index.html for our <app-root> selector)


NOTE:
"index.html" is the Homepage for any Angular-App
=> Basic flow of Execution:-
(main.ts --> app.module.ts --> app.component.ts -> selector -> .html+.css file for display)



==> About Modules & Components in Angular-App:-
=> Root Module (AppModule)
= Every Angular-App has Root-Module (AppModule -> app.module.ts)
= this file is in (src\app\app.module.ts)
= Under ths Root-Module we have 1 root-component

=> Root Component (AppComponent)
= this file in under (src\app\app.component.ts)
= In this typescript file, we have selector (<app-root>)
= For this selector, we have corresponding view or display (.html+.css files)
= app.component.html + app.component.css

NOTE:
= In app.component.ts file, we have a class (AppComponent)
= This class contains (data-prop + methods/funcs)
= These class-members can be used in views (app.component.html)

==> Module V/s Component:-
= Module is collection of different components
= Component is nothing but view in webpage

NOTE:
= Every Angular-App has only 1-Root-Module & only 1-Root-Component

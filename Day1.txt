==>> Todays Session:-
=> What is Typescript?
=> Introduction & History of Typescript
=> How to setup Typescript in Windows OS


=> Angular Sessions:
= 50+ Sessions
= 1st Week to 10-days (Free typescript)
= Daily timings (8PM)
= Daily 1-hour
----------------------------
= Every session is recorded
(Recording will be provided to Students)
= For Every Sessions Notes or Material will be provided

NOTE:
= Recording Videos, Notes or Material will be given on daily basis
(Sharing with Google-Drive)
= Gmail ID : "srikanth.sai.online@gmail.com"


===>> Typescript:-
= TypeScript allows us write JavaScript as per our requirements
(Programming in a webpage)
(HTML+CSS does not have programming capability)

= TypeScript is a typed-superset of JavaScript
==Diagram==

= TypeScript provides Object-Oriented concepts like
classes, 
interfaces etc 
(like Java, .Net Programming Languages)

==(OOP concepts - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)


NOTE:-
Every typescript is converted to javascript
(.ts -----> .js)
Why this conversion?
(Till today Browser understands only JavaScript)

=>Transpilation:-
It is the process of converting typescript into javascript

NOTE:-
Before Angular is executed for user in browser, in server-only .ts is converted to .js

==>> Other Scripting Languages which compiles to JavaScript:-
= Dart
= Elm
= PureScript
= CoffeeScript
= ClojureScript
= Scala.js
= Reason (by FaceBook)
= Haxe
= Nim


NOTE:
= Angular Framework in re-written in TypeScript
= TypeScript allows us to write both client and server-side scripts
= Advantage is, Building web-applications Quick and Fast

=> Prerequisites for TypeScript::::
= JavaScript
= OOP concepts of PL


==>>> Introduction and History of TypeScript:-
= Javascript is a client-side scripting language for Programming in HTML Webpage
= Node.js is server-side scripting language
= In Enterprise-Application, Javascript is complex and difficult to maintain
= TypeScript is best alternative for this with features like OO, Type-checking etc.


=> Definition::::
TypeScript is Javascript for developing Web-application, it is OO, Compiled Language and Typed Language

=> History::::
= It was invented by Anders Hejlsberg, at Microsoft (1996)
= It is superset of Javascript
==(Diagram)==
= TypeScript is (Javascript+Additional Features)


==> Features of Typescript:::::
1) TypeScript is Javascript (converted)
2) Support for Javascript Libraries
3) Javascript to TypeScript (.js to .ts) 
4) Portable (Browser, OS, Devices)
5) OO Scripting Language (OOP Features)
6) Typed Scripting Language (datatypes)
7) Classes and Modules
8) Generics and Type-Annotations

==> Advantages of TypeScript:::: (Why TypeScript?)
1) Compiled Scripting Lang. (Compiler, Errors) - (Transpiler)
2) Typed Scripting Lang. (Datatypes)
3) Support Other Javascript Libraries
4) Supports OOP like Classes, Interfaces, Inheritance etc.


===>>> How to Setup Environment for Typescript:::::
1) In Windows OS::::
= Typescript is open-source technology (Free-of-Cost)
= It can run on any Browser, any OS, any Device and also on any Server-Machine (Java/.Net/Python/PHP Servers)


= Software/Tools Requirements are,
	A) Text-Editor (Notepad, Edit-Plus, Notepad++, Emacs, Vi or Vim)
		//File Extensions are ".ts"
			
		
	B) Typescript-Compiler 
		//Converts ".ts" file into ".js" file 
		(process is known as "Transpilation")
		//It is also known as "Transcompiler/Transpiler" 
		(.ts files ----> .js)

	C) Node.js (Cross platform Server-Side RT Environment for JS)	
		//Runs Javascript W.O Browser
		(https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
			
		//Install and Verify it by opening Command-Prompt and type the following command (node -v) & Check the version
		
		//*** Now install Typescript in CMD by using the following the command 
		(npm install -g typescript)
		
		//*** Verify it by typing the following command (tsc (or) tsc -v)

	D) IDE Support:-
		//Visual Studio (Code) (Best for Windows OS), 
		Sublime Text 2, 
		WebStorm/PHPStorm, 
		Eclipse, 
		Brackets (Optional for Windows OS) etc.
		
		//Download and Install "Visual Studio Code - Open Source IDE" from (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

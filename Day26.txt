=> Property-Binding in Angular Webpage:-
= HTML attributes are technically known as HTML-Properties (DOM-Properties)

Ex:-
<p align="center">	//left,right
.....
.....
</p>

= align="center" (HTML-Attribute) (name,value) pair
= When we change this HTML-Attribute (value) then it is known as DOM-Property value

NOTE:-
= HTML tags/elements/attributes are coded by developer
= Once HTML-page runs in browser, then in browser-memory HTML-page is represented as DOM (Document-Object-Model)

= Here HTML-Attribute are known as DOM-Properties

= HTML-Attributes are intialized by developer
= Where as DOM-Properties are given/changed by Browser dynamically


Ex1:
<input type="text" id="..." name="..." value="..." disabled="..." />

= Here type,id,name,value,disabled are HTML-attr/DOM-Properties

NOTE:-
= Once HTML-webpage is executed in the memory of Browser then it is known as DOM-Webpage

Ex2:
<input type="text" name="uname" value="SaiRam" .../>
= Here, value="SaiRam" (HTML-attribute)
= Here "SaiRam" is initial value displayed in text-box
= Now, when user changes this value in text-box (Ex: "AliKhan") then value="AliKhan" (DOM-Property)

NOTE:-
= Such HTML-Properties are (name,value) pairs 
= These values are generally static (given at coding-time)
= However, we can make these values dynamic using Property-Binding of Angular
= It is done with [...] Binding-Operator
= This operator allows data flow from Component-Class variables to HTML Properties

= Ex:	[id] = "myId"
		[disabled] = "bool"
		<p [align]="x">
		</p>
		
= Here myId,bool are data-properties in comp-class
Ex:
	myId = "userid";
	bool = true;
	x = center; //right,left
	
=> Other Syntax:-
	bind-disabled = "bool"
= This is used instead of [] binding-operator
= It is prefix to HTML-attribute (bind-), used before attributes in html-tags
Ex:
	bind-align="x"
	bind-width="w"	//w is width	(define in comp-class as var)
	bind-height="h"	//h is height
	
	
//Program (comp2 ---> demo-app)
(Create a Webpage to perform Property-Binding in Angular Webpage)

cmd>ng g c comp2		(under demo-app)
g -> generate
c -> component	
	
NOTE:
= Property-Binding in Angular for HTML-Attributes is capable of providing dynamic values for those attributes which can be modified manually
Ex: disabled="false"; //always true

= Here we can also use interpolation {{}} but it works only for string but not boolean values
Ex:
disabled="{{bool}}"	//does not work
[disabled]="{{bool}}"	//works
= where bool is data-prop as true in comp-class

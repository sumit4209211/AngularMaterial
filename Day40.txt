==>> Routing(SPA) & Navigation in Angular:-
= Navigation means take control from one-page to another in Webpage
= Routing means taking control from one view to another view in single-page

NOTE:-
= Navigation happens between 2 different pages
= Routing happens in a single

=> What is SPA?
= It is a Webpage in our Web-App, in which Initial Request goes to the server and we get response as Single-Page

= In this Single-Page, we have different links for navigation(routing) with in same webpage

= When such links are clicked for navigation, we get display/view in same Webpage

= Your complete Web-App task is done in one Single-Page itself
Ex:
	Gmail
	Facebook
	Twitter
	Google News
	Most IT/Business Websites
	etc

NOTE:
= By default all Angular application are SPA with index.html displaying Root-Comp(app.component.html) as Home-Page and then all child components as different views in Home-Page

= We use links <a> anchors for navigations, known as Routing
= Each navigation page is one component in angular-application


//Program (spa-app)
cmd>ng new spa-app
cmd>cd spa-app
cmd>ng serve -o

=> Steps for SPA:-
1) 
Import "RouterModule" from "@angular/router" in "app.module.ts"(root-module)
Example, 
import { RouterModule} from '@angular/router';

= Also include that under imports-array

2)
= Create a multiple-component(comp1/comp2/comp3/comp4/comp5) in you app
cmd>ng g component comp1/2/3/4/5

3)
Above module is included in the "imports" with Routing configurations as follows,

Example,
RouterModule.forRoot([
      {
         path: 'comp1',
         component: Comp1Component
      },
	  {
         path: 'comp2',
         component: Comp3Component
      },
	  .....
    ])

NOTE:
= "RouterModule" refers to forRoot(), which takes array-of-objects as input 
= This array has multiple-objects {} with 'path' and 'component' members
= "path" is name of router (used in links)
= "component" is the name of the component-class

4) 
Now, goto different child-component classes, add  data-members
msg1 = "Hello from Component1; 
(msg1/msg2/msg3/msg4/msg5)


5) Goto respective child-component templates and prepare different views (.html files)
Ex:
<p>
  {{msg1}}	//msg1/msg2/msg3/msg4/msg5
</p>
<p>
  comp1 works!	//comp1/comp2/comp3/comp4/comp5
</p>


6) Now prepare your Single-Page navigation links in Root-Component as follows, (.html file)
(app.component.html)
<nav>
	<a routerLink="comp1">Link1</a>
	......
</nav>

NOTE:	(not-compulsory)
<nav></nav>
This element is used to group different routing links in a webpage
= This element is introuced in HTML-5

NOTE:-
= In <a> tag instead of href="" attribute we use "routerLink" directive as our navigation reference
= with href="" complete-page is refreshed
= using routerLink="" only partial page is refreshed for view

7) 
For Single-Page display we use this special element from Angular
<div>
    <router-outlet>
    </router-outlet>
</div>

= inside this <router-outlet> element, all our single-page links data(view) will be displayed


8)
Now, verify your SPA usage in Angular by clicking on different links

NOTE:
{
    path: '',   //default-navigation
    component: Comp1Component
},
.....
//last
{
    path: '**', //any missing navigation
    component: Comp1Component
}

===>> Advantage:-
= Instead of loading the whole page as response,using SPA, we can perform partial-page updates
= This reduces burden on server
= It also reduces network traffic


NOTE:-
= (app-routing.module.ts) is a new file created auto with every angular-routing app
= we use this file to simplify our coding in root-module(app.module.ts) by importing this class and adding to imports array
Ex:-(app.module.ts)
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
(and)
imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ]

Ex:- (app-routing.module.ts)
  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
  import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

  import { Comp1Component } from './comp1/comp1.component';
  import { Comp2Component } from './comp2/comp2.component';
  import { Comp3Component } from './comp3/comp3.component';
  import { Comp4Component } from './comp4/comp4.component';
  import { Comp5Component } from './comp5/comp5.component';

  const routes: Routes = [
    {
      path: '',   //default-navigation
      component: Comp1Component
    },
    {
      path: 'comp1',
      component: Comp1Component
    },
    {
      path: 'comp2',
      component: Comp2Component
    },
    {
      path: 'comp3',
      component: Comp3Component
    },
    {
      path: 'comp4',
      component: Comp4Component
    },
    {
      path: 'comp5',
      component: Comp5Component
    },
    {
      path: '**', //any missing navigation
      component: Comp1Component
    }
  ];

  @NgModule({
    imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
    exports: [RouterModule]
  })
  export class AppRoutingModule { }

= also import all component-classes used for links in this file
Ex:-
import { Comp1Component } from './comp1/comp1.component';
...
etc

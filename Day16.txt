==> Todays Topics:-
= Environment Setup for Angular
= Project Setup for Angular
= Creating First Angular-Application (Tomorrow)


=> Revision:-
= What is Angular? (Typescript)
= What is AngularJS? (Javascript)

= AJS (2009)
= Angular(TS) 2016

NOTE:
=Google team had developed both AJS & ATS

= Angular 8 (May 28th, 2019)

=> Why Angular when compared to AJS?
1) 5 times faster 
2) Modular Programming
3) Application Platform
4) Scripting Lang Options
(Typescript,Purescript,Dart,ELM etc)
5) Unit Testable

=> Versions:- 2/4/5/6/7/8

==>> Environment & Project Setup for Angular:-
=> Software Requirements
	= Nodejs (Latest)
	= Npm (Latest)
	= Angular CLI (Latest online install)
	= IDE for writing your code (Visual-Studio-Code)

NOTE:-
= 1st install Visual-Studio-Code and Open it (for Windows - Stable-Build)
(https://code.visualstudio.com/)
= IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
i.e,(Other) WebStrom, Atom, Sub-Lime etc

= Why IDE?
(Creating Angular Projects, Compiling or Building, Running, Verifying Ouput)


= Open Terminal & Goto your working-directory
(G:\AngularOnline\Angular>)

NOTE:
= Terminal is nothing but command prompt

1) Installing "Nodejs"
=> Check Nodejs:
cmd> node -v
(Install Nodejs from  https://nodejs.org/en/download/ based on your OS)

NOTE:
Nodejs is intalled in our system at
(C:\Program Files\Nodejs)


2) NPM Installation
=> Check npm:
= It is installed by default along with "nodejs"
cmd> npm -v

=> What NPM?
(Node Package Manager)
= It allows us to install Open-Source Javascript Libraries/Packages into our Angular Application using Node Development Environment


3) Angular CLI Installation:-
= Install from (https://cli.angular.io)
= Follow the required steps

cmd>npm install -g @angular/cli 
(-g indicated global installation of angular/cli in your system)
i.e, we can develop and run your angular-app anywhere from any folder


=> What is Angular CLI?
(Command Line Interface)
= Using commands we can create our project application files and folder in our system for development


=> Check Angular CLI:
cmd>ng v(version)
//we get angular/cli -version, node -version, win64 OS, Angular-Packages versions

NOTE:
(Software Requirements for Angular)
1) VS Code
2) NodeJS
3) NPM (auto installed)
4) Angular CLI


=> Creating First Application in Angular:-
cmd>ng new my-first-app(FirstApp)
cmd>cd my-first-app(FirstApp)
cmd>my-first-app(FirstApp)>ng serve

NOTE:
= Angular Live Development Server is online at http://localhost:4200
= Open the browser and type above URL to view your FirstApp Homepage

= Programs on Operators

=> Operators in Typescript:-
= Operators are symbols which are used to perform some Operations on Values in a Program
= Example,
10 + 20 = 30
//Here 10, 20 are values(Operands)
//+, = are Operators


= Typescript supports the following Operators
1) Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, ++, --)
2) Logical operators	(&&, ||, !)
3) Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)	
4) Bitwise operators	(&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
5) Assignment operators	(=)
6**) Ternary/conditional operator	(? :)
7) String operator	(+)
8) typeof Operator	(type(var))
9) Misc Operators	(negation(-), instanceof)


1) Arithmetic Operators:
= They are 
+ (Addition), 
- (Subtraction), 
* (Multiplication), 
/ (Division), 
% (Modulo), 
++ (Increment), 
-- (Decrement)

//Program
(Program to perform Basic Arithmetic Operations)


2) Relational Operators: (Comparision Operators)
= Performs relation between 2 values and gives true or false. They are,
>	(Greater than)
<	(Lesser than)
>=	(Greater than or equal to)
<=	(Lesser than or equal to)
==	(Equality)
!=	(Not-equal)

//Program
(Program to perform Relational Operations)


3) Logical Operators:
= They combine 2 or more conditions and give the result as true or false. They are,
&& (AND) - if all conditions are true then only it is true
|| (OR) - if any 1-condition is true then it is true
! (NOT) - true is false and false is true

//Program
(Program to perform Logical Operations)


4) Bitwise Operators:
= They are used to perform operations on bit-levels of given values. They are,
& (Bitwise AND)
| (BitWise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise Not)	
<< (Left Shift)
>> (Right Shift)

//Program
(Program to perform Bitwise Operations)


5) Assignment Operators:
= It is used to assign a value to a variable. They are,
= (Simple Assignment)
Ex:-
a=10;
b=20;
sum=a+b;

+= (Add and Assignment)			Ex: a+=b; (a=a+b)
-= (Subtract and Assignment)	Ex: a-=b; (a=a-b)
*= (Multiply and Assignment)	Ex: a*=b; (a=a*b)
/= (Divide and Assignment)		Ex: a/=b; (a=a/b)
%= (Modulo and Assignment)		Ex: a%=b; (a=a%b)

//Program
(Program to perform Assignment Operations)


6) Ternary/conditional operator:
= This operator checks for a condition and executes true-part or false-part
= It is  ? :
Example,
(expr1) ? (expr2) : (expr3)

//Program
(Program to perform Conditional Operation)


7) String-Addition Operator:
= + operator combines 2 Strings into single-string 
(appends 2nd string at the end of 1st string)
Example,
	"Hello"+"World" ==> "HelloWorld"
	string+number ==> string
	number+string ==> string

//Program
(Program to perform String-Addition Operation)

8) typeof Operator:
= It is a unary operator. 
= It returns the data-type of the operand

//Program
(Program to perform typeof Operation)


9) Other Operators::
A) Negation Operator: (-)
= It returns negation of a given number 
i.e, changes the sign of given number

//Program
(Program to perform Negation Operation)

B) instanceof Operator:
= It is used to test if an object is of a specified type or not.
= Use in classes concept

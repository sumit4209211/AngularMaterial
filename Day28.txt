==> Events in Angular:-
= Event is a communication between a user and HTML Webpage

= In Javascript, we have some events such as,
onClick=""
onChange=""
onKeyPress
onKeyDown
onMouseOver
onMouseEnter
onMouseExit
onFocus
onBlur
onSubmit
onScroll
...etc


= When these events occur in webpage, we perform some operation or call a Javascript/Typescript function

= In Angular, we process or work with these events as "Event-Binding" Mechanism (Event-Handling)


NOTE:-
= Here in Event-Binding, we send or flow the information from HTML to Component-class
= Event occurs in view (.html) & we perform some action in component-class (.ts)
= (.html) ----> (.ts)

= For this we use () Event-Binding operator
Ex:
(click) = "f1()"
(mouseover) = "f2()"
etc...

= All JS/TS events work in Angular but without on-prefix
Ex:-
	onclick ====> (click)="f1()"
	oninput ====> (input)="f2()"

= Finally, this whole process in known as "Event-Handling Mechanism"


Ex:- (comp33 - "demo-app")
cmd> ng g c comp33
<div>
    <p id="p1" (mouseover)="f1()" (mouseout)="f2()">
        {{msg}}
    </p>
</div>

(and)
//Add in component-class(.ts file)

  msg="Bring cursor here...";
    
  f1()
  {
    console.log("Your Cursor is on Paragraph");
    this.msg="Your cursor is on Paragraph";
  }
  f2()
  {
    console.log("Your Cursor is out of Paragraph");
    this.msg="Your cursor is out of Paragraph";
  }


NOTE:
1)
= $event is a special-variable provided by Angular Framework for every webpage for Events

= It is an object in our component-class

= This object can be used as parameter to our Event-Handling function and get info. about our event such as (target,type,(x,y)coordinates)
Ex:-
event.pageX
event.pageY
---------------
event.target.value
----------------
event.type


2)
= When event-occurs instead of calling function, we can also perform operations directly
Ex: (click)="x=x+1;"
= Here instead of calling any-function, we can perform operation directly


//Program (comp44 ---> "demo-app")
(Create a webpage to perform likes and dislike count in Angular using Event-Binding)

cmd> ng g c comp44

Ex:-
<button (click)="count = count + 1">Increment</button> 
{{count}}
<button (click)="count = count - 1">Decrement</button> 
(and)
count=0;


NOTE:
1) Ternary/Conditional Operations
Syntax:
	(expr1)?(expr2):(expr3)
= if (expr1) is true then (expr2) is executed
= if (expr1) is false then (expr3) is executed

//Program
(Create a webpage to perform (mouseover) and (mouseout) events in Angular)

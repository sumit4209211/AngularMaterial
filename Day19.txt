=> Templates & Styles in a Component Class


==> Welcome Application in Angular:-

//Program (welcome-app)
(Program to display "Welcome Message" in welcome-app)

cmd>ng new welcome-app

= Move to Project-folder
cmd>cd welcome-app

= Now, compile and run the app in browser
cmd\welcome-app> ng serve

NOTE:-
= ng server (npm start) alternate-cmd
= What is the work of "ng serve"?
Step1:-
= It compiles all our .ts files into .js files

Step2:-
= Angular Live Development Server is started
(This server is provided by Node)

Step3:-
= Our Application is Deployed on Server

Step4:-
= Our App Homepage starts with index.html

NOTE:-
npm command is related to node
ng command is related to Angular


NOTE:-
./ (indicated current-directory)
. means current
/ means directory


NOTE:- 
Any changes done to .html or .css file for our component file providing view, they are auto compiled on server and the browser also auto refreshes the webpage


NOTE:
= WebSever starts at port no. 4200 in your local-system
= Type the URL in Browser (http://localhost:4200/)
= On successful deployment of our application, we get Angular Homepage


NOTE:
=> Make changes to below files
	= app.component.html
	= app.component.ts (change title='Angular')
	
=> Any changes done to data-properties of component-class(AppComponent), they are reflected in view (wherever we are using them)
Ex:
	<h1>
		Welcome to {{title}}!
	</h1>
	
=> What is {{}}	?
= It is syntax from Angular to display data from Component class
= It is known as Binding Expression
= What ever dynamic data or function used to display to user is done by {{}}

NOTE:-
= this process is known as Inter-polation
(reflecting data-properties or functions from Component class to view using .html file)


=> Working with AppComponent class:-
(Root-Component)

=> Add few more data-properties (uname,fname,lname)
=> Add few more functions/methods (fullname())

NOTE:-
=** var, function keywords are not required in component-class


=> Default port for angular/cli is 4200. 
However we can change this using following command
cmd>ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4028 --open
cmd>ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4208 --open

NOTE:
= Stop the Angular Live Development Server in terminal using (Ctrl+C)

=> Other Command (Running-Server)
cmd>ng serve --o
cmd>ng serve -o
cmd>ng serve --open
= --o indicates open default browser to run your-app
= --open
= -o
